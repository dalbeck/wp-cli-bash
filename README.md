# WP CLI Benchmarking Script with WebPageTest.org and Security Vulnerability Scan Integration

## Description

This Bash script is designed for comprehensive performance and security analysis of WordPress installations. It integrates WebPageTest.org for frontend testing, Wordfence for security assessments, and MySQL Tuner for database performance analysis.

### Automated Tasks

- **Code Profiler Pro Execution**: Analyzes code performance.
- **WP CLI Profile Commands**: Detailed profiling of WordPress stages.
- **WP CLI Doctor Checks**: Health checks and diagnostics.
- **WP CLI DB Checks**: Analyze auto load data and orphaned postmeta.
- **Custom WP DB Queries**: Analysis of autoloaded data.
- **WebPageTest.org Tests**: Frontend performance analysis.
- **Wordfence Security Scan**: Vulnerability scanning using Wordfence.
- **MySQLTuner**: MySQL performance analysis.

### Outputs

Results are stored in the `wp-benchmarks` directory.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Verify WP CLI installation.
3. Navigate to the WordPress root.

## Usage

Run `./wp-benchmark.sh` in the WordPress root directory. The script handles necessary installations and outputs. Support added for Roots.io Bedrock file structure.

```bash
chmod +x wp-benchmark.sh
./wp-benchmark.sh
```

### WebPageTest.org Integration

Set `WPT_API_KEY` or provide it when prompted. Monitors test progress and provides detailed performance results.

### Wordfence Security Integration

Offers the option to run a Wordfence security scan, identifying vulnerabilities and providing detailed reports.

### MySQL Tuner Integration
Have your MySQL Database username and password ready. The script will prompt you for them and generate a `.my.cnf` file for authenticating and scanning the database.

## Profiling and Security Analysis

- **Performance Profiling**: `wp profile` command breaks down execution stages. Focus on metrics like `cache_ratio`, `cache_hits`, and `query_time`.
- **Security Scanning**: Wordfence provides detailed vulnerability reports.

## Interpreting Profiling Results

- `wp profile` breaks down the WordPress execution process into stages for detailed analysis.
- Look for high `cache_ratio`, more `cache_hits` than `cache_misses`, and low `query_time`.
- Use `grep` for investigating specific hooks.
```bash
grep -rHin "hook_name_here" wp-content/themes
```
