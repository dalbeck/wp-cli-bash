# WP CLI Benchmarking Script with WebPageTest.org and Security Vulnerability Scan Integration

## Description

This Bash script is designed for comprehensive performance and security analysis of WordPress installations. It integrates WebPageTest.org for frontend testing and WPScan for security assessments.

### Automated Tasks

- **Code Profiler Pro Execution**: Analyzes code performance.
- **WP CLI Profile Commands**: Detailed profiling of WordPress stages.
- **WP CLI Doctor Checks**: Health checks and diagnostics.
- **WP CLI DB Checks**: Analyze auto load data and orphaned postmeta.
- **Custom WP DB Queries**: Analysis of autoloaded data.
- **WebPageTest.org Tests**: Frontend performance analysis.
- **Wordfence Security Scan**: Vulnerability scanning using Wordfence.

### Outputs

Results are stored in the `wp-benchmarks` directory.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Verify WP CLI installation.
3. Navigate to the WordPress root.

## Usage

Run `./wp-benchmark.sh` in the WordPress root directory. The script handles necessary installations and outputs.

```bash
chmod +x wp-benchmark.sh
./wp-benchmark.sh
```

### WebPageTest.org Integration

Set `WPT_API_KEY` or provide it when prompted. Monitors test progress and provides detailed performance results.

### Wordfence Security Integration

Offers the option to run a Wordfence security scan, identifying vulnerabilities and providing detailed reports.

## Profiling and Security Analysis

- **Performance Profiling**: `wp profile` command breaks down execution stages. Focus on metrics like `cache_ratio`, `cache_hits`, and `query_time`.
- **Security Scanning**: Wordfence provides detailed vulnerability reports.

## Interpreting Profiling Results

- `wp profile` breaks down the WordPress execution process into stages for detailed analysis.
- Look for high `cache_ratio`, more `cache_hits` than `cache_misses`, and low `query_time`.
- Use `grep` for investigating specific hooks.
```bash
grep -rHin "hook_name_here" wp-content/themes
```
